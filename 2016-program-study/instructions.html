<h2>Atoms Impact Experiment Materials</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>


<hr/>
<h3>Pre-study</h3>
<p>
Before doing the experiment, all subjects needed to sign a 
<a href="consent.pdf">consent form</a>. This form explains the purpose
of this experiment, and informs the subject that the participation is
voluntary.
</p>

</ul>

</ul><h3>Core materials</h3>

<h4>Instructions</h4>

We designed instructions for <a href="in-person.html">in-person</a> 
study, and <a href="remote.html">remote</a> study, as some of our
subjects were remote. 

<h4>Questions and sample answers</h4>

<p>In total, we designed four programs, each with its confusing (with 
atoms) and non-confusing version (with atoms removed). The full list
of programs can be found <a href="questions.html">here</a>. They are 
named as question A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H, respectively. For example, question 
A and B are the confusing and non-confusing version of the same program.
For each subject, we chose a random subset of four out of the eight questions, 
and made sure that they do not see both the confusing and non-confusing
version of the same program.</p>

<p>After each experiment with a subject, we scanned the hand written 
results, normalized and transcribed the results. Here is a 
<a href="sample.html">sample answer</a> from a subject after we obtained 
consent. The answer includes both the hand written and the transcribed 
versions.</p>

Full data set (normalized and transcribed) will be available 
soon.

<hr/>
</ul><h3>Post-study</h3>

Subjects completed a <a href="survey.pdf">demographic survey</a>
after finishing all the questions.
