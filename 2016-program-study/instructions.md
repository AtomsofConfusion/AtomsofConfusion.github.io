### Pre-study
Before doing the experiment, all subjects needed to sign a 
[consent form](consent.pdf). This form explains the purpose
of this experiment, and informs the subject that the participation is
voluntary.

### Core materials

#### Instructions

We designed instructions for [in-person](in-person)
study, and [remote](remote) study, as some of our
subjects were remote. 

#### Questions and sample answers

In total, we designed four programs, each with its confusing (with 
atoms) and non-confusing version (with atoms removed). The full list
of programs can be found [here](questions). They are 
named as question A/B/C/D/E/F/G/H, respectively. For example, question 
A and B are the confusing and non-confusing version of the same program.
For each subject, we chose a random subset of four out of the eight questions, 
and made sure that they do not see both the confusing and non-confusing
version of the same program.

After each experiment with a subject, we scanned the hand written 
results, normalized and transcribed the results. Here is a 
[sample answer](sample) from a subject after we obtained 
consent. The answer includes both the hand written and the transcribed 
versions.

Full data set (normalized and transcribed) will be available 
soon.

### Post-study

Subjects completed a [demographic survey](survey.pdf)
after finishing all the questions.
