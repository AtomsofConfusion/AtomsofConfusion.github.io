<h2>Email instructions for remote study</h2>

<p>Hello, and thank you for participating in our code comprehension 
study.</p>

<p>This study should take roughly an hour. If you donâ€™t have an hour 
of uninterrupted time right now, please close this email now and come 
back later when you have a whole hour free.
</p>

<p>Attached to this email is a consent form and our code comprehension 
test. Please follow the instructions listed in the test and answer 
every question in the order it's presented. In addition, since you are 
completing this survey remotely, please be extra careful to avoid:</p>

<li><b>Distractions</b> - This test takes concentration, so please try to work 
in a quiet, isolated environment.</li>

<li><b>Outside resources</b> - This test is supposed to help us understand 
how programmers comprehend C/C++ programs, not how well programmers 
can use Google. Please do not use any outside material, and do not 
execute the code on an actual computer. The results of your test will 
be anonymized and your answers will not be attributed to you.</li>

<li><b>Silent misunderstandings</b> - If, after the test is over, you 
believe you did something that does not comply with our procedure, 
please let us know so we can decide whether or not to use your data.</li>

<p>Thanks again!</p>
