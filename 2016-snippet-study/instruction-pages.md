### Instructions

Thank you for volunteering for this research project. The purpose of this study is to understand how well programmers understand programming features.

If you don't have at least 3 months of experience with C/C++, please stop and do not continue. Contact the experimenter right now.

You will be asked to provide the outcome of many short C programs. You will not see whether your answers are correct or not. Try your best and complete each question as soon as you can.

You will see an example of a study question on the next screen prior to beginning the experiment.

### Examples

Here is an example that is similar to the questions you will see.

<pre>
void main() {
  int V1 = 1;
  float V2 = 2.0;
  printf("%d %f\n", V1, V2);
}
</pre>

<pre>Answer: ____________</pre>

You should enter "1 2" (one space two) in the textbox provided. Please note that:

- Enter a decimal number only when necessary. Enter 3 instead of 3.00 and 3.15 instead of 3.1500.
- Please enter answers in the right order. In the example above, 1 2 is correct but 2 1 is not correct.
