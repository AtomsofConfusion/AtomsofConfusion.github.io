### Pre-study

Before doing the experiment, all subjects needed to sign a [consent form](consent.pdf). This form explains the purpose of this experiment, and informs the subject that the participation is voluntary.

### Core materials

#### Instructions

All tests were administered via the web browser and [instructions](instruction-pages) were presented in several pages before the test began.

#### Questions and sample answers

Participants were asked to report the standard output of 84 tiny (3-22 line) programs chosen in pairs randomly from 126 total [questions](questions.csv).

### Post-study

Subjects completed a [demographic survey](survey.pdf)
after finishing all the questions.
