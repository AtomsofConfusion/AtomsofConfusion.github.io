To build a solid foundation we began by studying programming errors at the lowest level. We designed two studies to measure the level of confusion generated by [atoms of confusion](theory), minimally small obfuscating transformations to source code.

#### [Atom Existence: Snippets](2016-snippet-study)

We hypothesized a short list of extremely small transformations designed to confuse programmers. We tested these transformations against control code and measured the accuracy with which subjects were able to hand evaluate each type of code.

#### [Atom Impact: Programs](2016-program-study)

With the confusing code confirmed in the existence study, we built a larger experiment to study the combined effect. We took slightly larger, complete programs, and introduced several confusing transformations.
