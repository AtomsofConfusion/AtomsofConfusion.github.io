   <p>Atoms of Confusion is a project to discover the fundamental causes of human error in programming.</p>

   <p> Our investigation starts from the ground up, at the smallest pieces of code that cause confusion in programmers. We call these pieces of code <i>atoms of confusion</i> and we document their properties here. </p>

   <p>We are driven by the following principles: </p>

   <ul>
   <li>We group our hypotheses into a cohesive explanatory <a href="/theory/">theory</a>.</li>
   <li>We base our understanding on empirical evidence derived from <a href="/experiments/">experiments</a>.</li>
   <li>We strive to help the community by openly sharing all of our <a href="/data/">data</a>.</li>
   <li>We communicate our work through peer reviewed <a href="/publications/">publications</a>.</li>
