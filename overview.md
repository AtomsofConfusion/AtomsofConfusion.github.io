Source code serves a dual purpose. It communicates program
instructions to machines and programmer intent to people. 
Unfortunately, it is common for a person to come to a different conclusion
about the behavior of a piece of code than a machine does when executing
the program. In other words, a programmer's interpretation of a piece of
code's behavior differs from the machine's. While a difference of 
interpretation can naturally happen in some situations (such as those 
involving randomness, poorly understood APIs, or undefined behavior), it can 
also occur in small, self-contained lines of code.
These design patterns, which are easy to misinterpret, naturally lead 
to bugs in code.
