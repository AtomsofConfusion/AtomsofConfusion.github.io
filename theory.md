### Confusion

There is an objective concept we call *confusion* that occurs during manual evaluation of source code.
Confusion is observed when a programmer evaluates a piece of code differently than the language specification dictates.

### Atom

We propose there is a smallest unit of code that causes confusion. A piece of code that while confusing in its original form, cannot be shrunk without losing its ability to confuse readers. We call this smallest piece of confusing code an *atom*.
